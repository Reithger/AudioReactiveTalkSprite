# Audio Reactive Talk Sprite
 It's basically just my own (Ada/Reithger's) version of the PNGTuber software that I've made from scratch cause I'm difficult about things

 Currently working on making the live-run config options, as-is it'll run with my default skull image:

and while it could be customized in its config files directly, that isn't a user-friendly option at the moment.

Will also add more visual filters/effects over time, current you can have it darken, redden, mirror, and shake depending on your current 'loudness' through your mic.

It's a bit messy right now, I'll track down those dependency issues to clean it up once I've gotten the config stuff finished up; it's a small enough project that refactoring won't be that annoying to do.
