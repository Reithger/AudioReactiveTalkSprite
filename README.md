# Audio Reactive Talk Sprite
 It's basically just my own (Ada/Reithger's) version of the PNGTuber software that I've made from scratch cause I'm difficult about things

 Currently working on making the live-run config options, as-is it'll run with my default skull image:
 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db8cdba0-7e41-4c5b-8597-d30a27768fde)

and while it could be customized in its config files directly, that isn't a user-friendly option at the moment.

Will also add more visual filters/effects over time, current you can have it darken, redden, mirror, and shake depending on your current 'loudness' through your mic.
