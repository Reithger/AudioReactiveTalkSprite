 * Initial pop-up view should be of the available Profiles for quick-swapping between them or opening up an
 * editing menu; the currently read-in Profile should be at the top and obviously the current one.
 * 
 * TODO: Can set a Profile as the default; if no default set, just uses the last one you used
